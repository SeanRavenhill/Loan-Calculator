### Project: Loan Calculator

#### About
Personal finances are an important part of life. Sometimes you need some extra money and decide to take a loan, or you want to buy a house using a mortgage. To make an informed decision, you need to be able to calculate different financial parameters. Letâ€™s make a program that can help us with that!

#### Learning outcomes
You will practice using mathematics and Python in everyday tasks and learn how to use third-party modules and libraries. You will also learn more about different financial instruments.

#### *Personal Notes:
Great project this one. Really enjoyed it. Along with the currency converter this has been a good experience in working on programs that can translate to practical usage. Now if at any point I need to quickly work out any payments or other values related to a loan I can use my own program.

Was very useful in further exploring and understanding the power of breaking a large problem into smaller once and blocking off that logic into smaller functions.

Learnt some useful new applications of the Math Module and the ArgParse Module was also a very interesting new topic to learn and use. Command Line arguments have also proven to be very interesting to learn and the System Module is a great new tool to add to the roster.

Made use of the Python Documentation greatly in this project to fully understand the ArgParse module and to implement some UI output that I wanted to render in a particular way using the formatter_class RawDescriptionHelpFormatter.

I also challenged myself to write a program that would not crash and took all user input possibilities into account that I could think of.

Finally there are two version. v01 will function as a script you launch and the user inputs data when prompted. v02 functions as a command line interacted script.

Please use the command line execution of:
- python loan_calculator_v02.py -h
- python loan_calculator_v02.py --help

To see instructions of how to run the script with data input.

Thanks.
